    "Exactly who proposed the first algorithm to create such a Markov Chain is the subject of some debate. A general version was proposed by Hastings. Here we will describe an earlier version attributed to Metropolis and co-authors in 1953.\n",

    "The goal is to create a transition matrix $\\mathbb{P}$ so that $\\pi$ and $\\mathbb{P}$ together solve the detailed balance equations. \n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is based on any symmetric transition matrix $Q$ that creates an irreducible aperiodic chain on the state space. For example, if the state space is numerical you could start with, \"Wherever the chain is, it picks one of the three closest values (including itself) with probability $1/3$ each.\" For a pair of states $i$ and $j$, the transition probability $Q(i, j)$ is called the *proposal probability*.\n",

    "Here are the steps that determine the transitions of the new chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Suppose the chain is at $i$ at time $n$, that is, suppose $X_n = i$. Pick a state $j$ according to the proposal probability $Q(i, j)$. This $j$ is the candidate state to which your chain might move.\n",

    "Thus the new chain either moves to the state picked according to $Q$, or it stays where it is. We say that it *accepts a move to a new state* based on $Q$ and $r$, and otherwise it doesn't move. \n",
    "\n",
    "The new chain is irreducible because the proposal chain is irreducible. It is aperiodic because it can stay in place. So it has a steady state distribution. The alogrithm says that this steady state distribution is the same as the distribution $\\pi$ that was used to define the ratios $r(i, j)$."

    "### How to Think About the Algorithm ###\n",
    "Before we prove that the algorithm works, let's examine what it is doing in the context of decoders.\n",
    "\n",
    "First notice that we are requiring $Q$ to be symmetric as well as irreducible. The symmetry requirement makes sense as each detailed balance equation involves transitions $i \\to j$ as well as $j \\to i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fix any starting decoder and call it $i$. Now you have to decide where the chain is going to move next, that is, what the next decoder is going to be. The algorithm starts this process off by picking a decoder $j$ according to $Q$. We say that *$Q$ proposes a move to $j$*.\n",
    "\n",
    "To decide whether or not the chain should move to $j$, remember that the distribution $\\pi$ contains the likelihoods of all the decoders. You want to end up with decoders that have high likelihood, so it is natural to compare $\\pi(i)$ and $\\pi(j)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm does this by comparing the *acceptance ratio* $r(i, j) = \\pi(j)/\\pi(i)$ to 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "- If $r(i, j) \\ge 1$, the likelihood of $j$ is at least as large that of $i$, so you *accept the proposal* and move to $j$. \n",
    "\n",
    "- If $r(i, j) < 1$, the proposed decoder $j$ has *less* likelihood than the current $i$, so it is tempting to stay at $i$. But this risks the chain getting stuck at a local maximum. The algorithm provides a chance to avoid this, by tossing a biased coin. If the coin lands tails, the chain moves to $j$ even though $j$ has a *lower* likelihood than the current decoder $i$. The idea is that from this new position there might be paths to decoders that have the highest likelihoods of all."
