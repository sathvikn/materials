Indeed it's not easy to understand covariance physically as it has nasty units: for example, if $X$ is a weight in kilograms and $Y$ is height in centimeters, then the units of covariance is *kilogram centimeters*. Later in the course we will see how to normalize covariance to get the *correlation coefficient* that you used so often in Data 8. For now, here is a property that begins to show you that covariance can be helpful in quantifying dependence and independence."
