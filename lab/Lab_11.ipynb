By contrast, the *Chinese Restuarant Process* is a discrete time stochastic process that can be used as a model for clustering and does not assume a fixed number of clusters. Instead, the clusters evolve randomly as individuals enter, according to a specified probabilistic structure. The data could be categorical or numerical.\n",

Since then, the development of the theory of the stochastic process and its use in machine learning has been very much a Berkeley enterprise: Jim Pitman, David Aldous, and Mike Jordan are among the people involved. The restaurant analogy is due to Jim Pitman and our late colleague Lester Dubins, during one of their regular cafe meetings decades ago. Though there is a popular story that they came up with it while eating at a Chinese restaurant, in fact they were at the Strada on Bancroft and College. "

We prefer the second image because it consists only of the occupied tables.\n",
