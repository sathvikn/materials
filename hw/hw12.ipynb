    "\n",
    "1. Use a scanner or scanning app (such as CamScanner) to digitize your written assignments. Do not take pictures using your phone's camera app.\n",
    "2. For code portions, examine the generated pdf before uploading to make sure that it contains all of your work.\n",
    "3. When submitting to Gradescope, select the pages of your upload corresponding to each question. \n",
    "4. If you encounter any difficulties when submitting or exporting your assignment, please make a private Piazza post **before the deadline**. \n",
    "\n",
    "### **We will not grade assignments which do not have pages selected for each question, are illegibly scanned, or are submitted after 8PM.** \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part A (Written)\n",
    "- Make sure you have at least 6 pages of homework. Each problem should start on a new page; for example,  Problem 1 on page 1, Problem 2 on page 2, etc.\n",
    "- Scan all the pages into a PDF. **Make sure the PDF page size is 8.5 x 11 inches**. It is your responsibility to check that all the work on the scanned pages is legible. You can use any scanner or a phone using applications such as CamScanner. Save the PDF.\n",
    "- Upload the scanned PDF of your work onto Gradescope for the assignment \"HW_12A\". \n",
    "Refer to [this guide](http://gradescope-static-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/help/submitting_hw_guide.pdf) for detailed instructions about scanning and submitting, or consult course staff.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part B (Code)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Save your notebook using File > Save and Checkpoint.**\n",
    "2. Run the cell below to generate a pdf file.\n",
    "3. Download the pdf file and confirm that none of your work is missing or cut off.\n",
    "4. Submit the assignment to \"HW_12B\" on Gradescope. Use the entry code \"9GEKKD\" if you haven't already joined the class."
