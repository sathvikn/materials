    "#### How to Do Your Homework ####\n",
    "\n",
    "The point of homework is for you to try your hand at using what you've learned in class. The steps to follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Go to lecture, and also go over the relevant text sections **before** starting on the homework. This will remind you what was covered in class, and the text will typically contain examples not covered in lecture. The weekly Preparation Guide will list what you should read.\n",
    "- Go to discussion section and work on some of the practice problems **before** starting on the homework. \n",
    "- Attempt the homework problems **by yourself** with the text, your discussion section work, and practice materials all at hand. Sometimes the week's lab will help as well. The two steps above will help this step go faster and be more fruitful.\n",
    "- At this point, seek help if you need it. Don't ask how to do the problem â€“ ask how to get started, or for a nudge to get you past where you are stuck.\n",
    "- For a good measure of your understanding, keep track of the fraction of the homework you can do by yourself or with minimal help. It's a better measure than your homework score, and only you can measure it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rules for Written Homework ####\n",
    "\n",
    "- Every answer should contain a calculation or reasoning. For example, a calculation such as $(1/3)(0.8) + (2/3)(0.7)$ is fine without further explanation or simplification. If we want you to simplify, we'll ask you to. But just ${5 \\choose 2}$ is not fine; write \"we need 2 out of the 5 frogs and they can appear in any order\" or whatever reasoning you used. Reasoning can be brief and abbreviated, e.g. \"product rule\" or \"not mut. excl.\"\n",
    "- You may consult others (see \"How to Do Your Homework\" above) but you must write up your own answers using your own words, notation, and sequence of steps.\n",
    "- We'll be using Gradescope. **Each question should *start* on a new page. No page should contain two questions.** However, each question (and its subparts, if any) may extend over multiple pages. \n",
    "- You must submit the homework according to the instructions in Problem 8 below.\n"
