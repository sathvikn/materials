If we want you to simplify, we'll ask you to. But just ${5 \\choose 2}$ is not fine; write \"we need 2 out of the 5 frogs and they can appear in any order\" or whatever reasoning you used. Reasoning can be brief and abbreviated, e.g. \"product rule\" or \"not mut. excl.\"\n",

To ensure the correct page size, we recommend placing the folded part on a blank page before scanning, or adjusting the page settings on your phone scanning app.\n",
