    "# Homework 6 #\n",
    "This homework set consists of the problems from the Spring 2017 midterm, apart from a few changes due to different sequencing and coverage this year. It **only involves written work; there are no coding parts**. It is your responsibility to ensure that your homework is submitted completely and properly to Gradescope. Refer to the bottom of the notebook for submission instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendation ###\n",
    "Use this homework as an opportunity to assess your preparation for the upcoming midterm. Don't start it before you have completed the bulk of your review for the exam. Do your review, set aside all the course materials, find a place where you can work on your own, and give yourself 80 minutes to do the assignment. The problems that you are not able to do in that time will give you an indication of where you need to focus the remaining portion of your review.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rules for Written Homework ####\n",
    "\n",
    "- Every answer should contain a calculation or reasoning. For example, a calculation such as $(1/3)(0.8) + (2/3)(0.7)$ is fine without further explanation or simplification. If we want you to simplify, we'll ask you to. But just ${5 \\choose 2}$ is not fine; write \"we need 2 out of the 5 frogs and they can appear in any order\" or whatever reasoning you used. Reasoning can be brief and abbreviated, e.g. \"product rule\" or \"not mut. excl.\"\n",
    "- You may consult others but you must write up your own answers using your own words, notation, and sequence of steps.\n",
    "- In the interest of saving trees, you do not need to *solve* each question on a new piece of paper. Folding the paper to show just the relevant problem will suffice. To ensure the correct page size, we recommend placing the folded part on a blank page before scanning, or adjusting the page settings on your phone scanning app.\n",
    "- You will submit a scanned PDF to Gradescope. **Each question should *start* on a new PDF page. No page should contain two questions.**"
