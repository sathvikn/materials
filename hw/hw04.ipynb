    "- Every answer should contain a calculation or reasoning. For example, a calculation such as $(1/3)(0.8) + (2/3)(0.7)$ is fine without further explanation or simplification. If we want you to simplify, we'll ask you to. But just ${5 \\choose 2}$ is not fine; write \"we need 2 out of the 5 frogs and they can appear in any order\" or whatever reasoning you used. Reasoning can be brief and abbreviated, e.g. \"product rule\" or \"not mut. excl.\"\n",
    "- You may consult others but you must write up your own answers using your own words, notation, and sequence of steps.\n",
    "- In the interest of saving trees, you do not need to *solve* each question on a new piece of paper. Folding the paper to show just the relevant problem will suffice. To ensure the correct page size, we recommend placing the folded part on a blank page before scanning, or adjusting the page settings on your phone scanning app.\n",
